Question,Response
What is a class in object-oriented programming?,"A class is a blueprint for creating objects, providing initial values for state (member variables) and implementations of behavior (member functions or methods)."
Explain the concept of inheritance in OOP.,Inheritance is a feature of OOP where a new class (child class) inherits the properties and behavior of an existing class (parent class). It promotes code reusability and establishes a relationship between different classes.
What is polymorphism in OOP?,Polymorphism is the ability of different objects to respond to the same function call in different ways. It allows methods to do different things based on the object it is acting upon.
Define encapsulation.,"Encapsulation is the concept of wrapping data (variables) and code (methods) together as a single unit. It restricts direct access to some of an object's components, which is a means of preventing accidental interference and misuse."
What is an interface in Java?,"An interface in Java is a reference type, similar to a class, that can contain only constants, method signatures, default methods, static methods, and nested types. Interfaces cannot contain instance fields."
Explain the difference between overloading and overriding.,Overloading is when two or more methods in the same class have the same name but different parameters. Overriding is when a method in a subclass has the same name and parameters as a method in the superclass.
What is the purpose of the 'super' keyword in Java?,"The 'super' keyword in Java is used to refer to the immediate parent class object. It can be used to call parent class methods, and to access the parent class constructor."
Define abstraction in OOP.,Abstraction is the concept of hiding the complex implementation details and showing only the essential features of the object. It can be achieved using abstract classes and interfaces.
What are design patterns?,Design patterns are typical solutions to commonly occurring problems in software design. They are like blueprints that can be customized to solve a particular design problem in your code.
Explain the Singleton design pattern.,The Singleton design pattern restricts the instantiation of a class to one single instance. This is useful when exactly one object is needed to coordinate actions across the system.
What is the difference between abstract class and interface?,"An abstract class can have method implementations and can be partially implemented, while an interface can only have method signatures and no implementations (until Java 8)."
What are the access specifiers in Java?,"Access specifiers in Java are keywords used to define the access scope of variables, methods, and classes. The common ones are public, private, protected, and default."
Define the MVC architecture.,"MVC stands for Model-View-Controller. It is an architectural pattern that separates an application into three main logical components: the model, the view, and the controller."
What is the difference between a process and a thread?,"A process is an instance of a program in execution, while a thread is a lightweight process that can run concurrently within a process."
Explain the concept of multithreading.,Multithreading is the concurrent execution of two or more threads. It is used to maximize the utilization of CPU.
What is a deadlock in multithreading?,"A deadlock is a situation where two or more threads are blocked forever, waiting for each other. It occurs when multiple threads need the same locks but obtain them in different orders."
How can you avoid deadlock in a multithreaded environment?,"Deadlock can be avoided by ensuring that all locks are always taken in the same order, using timeout values for thread waiting, or using deadlock detection algorithms."
What is a database transaction?,A database transaction is a sequence of operations performed as a single logical unit of work. A transaction must be either completed or aborted as a whole.
Define ACID properties.,"ACID stands for Atomicity, Consistency, Isolation, Durability. These are properties that ensure reliable processing of database transactions."
What is normalization in databases?,Normalization is the process of organizing data in a database to reduce redundancy and improve data integrity. It involves dividing a database into two or more tables and defining relationships between them.
Explain the different types of joins in SQL.,"Joins in SQL are used to combine rows from two or more tables, based on a related column between them. Common types are INNER JOIN, LEFT JOIN, RIGHT JOIN, and FULL JOIN."
What is an index in a database?,An index in a database is a data structure that improves the speed of data retrieval operations on a table at the cost of additional storage space and slower write operations.
What is a primary key?,A primary key is a field in a table that uniquely identifies each row/record in that table. It must contain unique values and cannot contain null values.
What is a foreign key?,A foreign key is a field in one table that is the primary key in another table. It is used to link two tables together.
Explain the concept of referential integrity.,"Referential integrity is a property of data stating that all its references are valid. In a relational database, it requires that a foreign key must have a matching primary key."
What is the difference between DELETE and TRUNCATE in SQL?,DELETE removes rows one at a time and records an entry in the transaction log for each deleted row. TRUNCATE removes all rows in a table without logging the individual row deletions.
What is a stored procedure?,A stored procedure is a prepared SQL code that you can save and reuse. You can think of them as a function in a programming language.
What are triggers in SQL?,Triggers are SQL statements that are automatically executed or fired when a specified event occurs in a database table. They are used to maintain the integrity of the data.
What is the difference between SQL and NoSQL databases?,"SQL databases are relational and use structured query language for defining and manipulating data. NoSQL databases are non-relational and can store data in a variety of ways, such as key-value pairs, wide-column stores, graph databases, or document stores."
Explain the CAP theorem.,"The CAP theorem states that in a distributed data store, it is impossible to simultaneously guarantee consistency, availability, and partition tolerance. Only two of these three can be achieved at the same time."
What is a RESTful API?,A RESTful API is an application programming interface that conforms to the constraints of REST architectural style and allows interaction with RESTful web services.
What are the HTTP methods commonly used in RESTful services?,"The HTTP methods commonly used in RESTful services are GET, POST, PUT, DELETE, PATCH, and OPTIONS."
What is JSON?,JSON (JavaScript Object Notation) is a lightweight data interchange format that is easy for humans to read and write and easy for machines to parse and generate.
Explain the concept of CORS.,CORS (Cross-Origin Resource Sharing) is a mechanism that allows restricted resources on a web page to be requested from another domain outside the domain from which the resource originated.
What is OAuth?,OAuth is an open-standard authorization protocol or framework that provides applications the ability to secure designated access.
What is the difference between authentication and authorization?,"Authentication is the process of verifying who a user is, while authorization is the process of verifying what they have access to."
What are microservices?,Microservices are a software development techniqueâ€”a variant of the service-oriented architecture (SOA) architectural style that structures an application as a collection of loosely coupled services.
What is Docker?,Docker is a set of platform-as-a-service products that use OS-level virtualization to deliver software in packages called containers.
What is Kubernetes?,"Kubernetes is an open-source system for automating the deployment, scaling, and management of containerized applications."
Explain continuous integration and continuous deployment (CI/CD).,Continuous integration (CI) is the practice of merging all developers' working copies to a shared mainline several times a day. Continuous deployment (CD) is the practice of automatically deploying every change that passes the automated tests.
What is version control?,Version control is a system that records changes to a file or set of files over time so that you can recall specific versions later.
What are the differences between Git and SVN?,"Git is a distributed version control system, meaning the entire codebase and history are available on every developer's computer, allowing for easy branching and merging. SVN is a centralized version control system, meaning it requires a single central repository."
What is Agile methodology?,Agile methodology is a practice that promotes continuous iteration of development and testing throughout the software development lifecycle of the project.
What is Scrum?,"Scrum is an Agile framework that helps teams work together. It encourages teams to learn through experiences, self-organize while working on a problem, and reflect on their wins and losses to continuously improve."
Explain the difference between unit testing and integration testing.,Unit testing is a type of software testing where individual units or components of a software are tested. Integration testing is the phase in software testing in which individual software modules are combined and tested as a group.
What is Test-Driven Development (TDD)?,"Test-Driven Development (TDD) is a software development process where requirements are turned into very specific test cases, and then the software is improved to pass the new tests, only."
What are the SOLID principles?,"SOLID principles are a set of five design principles intended to make software designs more understandable, flexible, and maintainable. They are: Single Responsibility Principle, Open-Closed Principle, Liskov Substitution Principle, Interface Segregation Principle, and Dependency Inversion Principle."
What is dependency injection?,"Dependency injection is a design pattern used to implement IoC (Inversion of Control), allowing the creation of dependent objects outside of a class and providing those objects to a class through different ways."
Explain the concept of a virtual machine.,"A virtual machine (VM) is a software computer that, like a physical computer, runs an operating system and applications. The VM is comprised of a set of specification and configuration files and is backed by the physical resources of a host."
What is cloud computing?,"Cloud computing is the delivery of different services through the Internet, including data storage, servers, databases, networking, and software."
